The Code:
(function(_name, _ns) {
...
})("TWITTER");

By default, the class that gets created is named TWITTER.
Rather than just assuming that you dont already have something named TWITTER that exists in the global namespace, however, this name is easily overrideable.
To call it something other than TWITTER, just change the string that is passed in to whatever you want the class to be named.  We'll take care of the rest.
(If you do change the name, however, just make sure that anywhere the documentation says "new TWITTER();", you change your code accordingly to reflect the new name);
